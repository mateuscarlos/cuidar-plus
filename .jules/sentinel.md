## 2026-02-01 - Committed Environment Secrets
**Vulnerability:** The `.env` file containing environment variables (potentially secrets) was tracked in the git repository.
**Learning:** Initial project setup or template generation failed to include `.env` in `.gitignore`, leading to accidental tracking of local configuration.
**Prevention:** Always verify `.gitignore` includes sensitive file patterns (`.env`, `*.pem`, etc.) before the first commit. Use pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets.
