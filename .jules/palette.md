## 2024-05-22 - Actionable Empty States
**Learning:** Empty states (like "No results found") are dead ends if they don't provide a way out. Users often feel stuck or think the system is broken.
**Action:** Always provide a primary action in empty states. For search/filter results, offer a "Clear Filters" button. For empty lists, offer a "Create New" button. This turns a dead end into a helpful guide.
