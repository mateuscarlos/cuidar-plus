## 2025-01-26 - Search Input Cleansing
**Learning:** Browser-native search inputs (`type="search"`) inject their own clear button, creating a "double X" visual glitch when a custom clear action is added.
**Action:** Always apply `[&::-webkit-search-cancel-button]:hidden` (or `appearance-none`) when building custom search components with Shadcn/Tailwind.

## 2025-01-26 - Icon-Only Button Accessibility
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons are invisible to screen readers without labels. Tooltips alone are insufficient for AT users.
**Action:** Pair `Tooltip` (for sighted users) with `aria-label` (for AT users) on every icon button.

## 2025-01-26 - Table Loading States
**Learning:** Replacing table content with a simple "Loading..." text breaks the visual structure and causes layout shifts.
**Action:** Use `Skeleton` components wrapped in `tr > td` (with `colSpan`) to maintain table dimensions and reduce perceived latency.
